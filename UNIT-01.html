  <h2>Kickstarter Conclusions</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Launch as a US based company.</strong>
        <br>
        Kickstarter, while an international company, is primarily used by the Western world. Over 73% of the launches come from the US and over 77% from North America.

      <li>
        <strong>Use Kickstarter if you want to fund an arts based project.</strong>
        <br>
        Kickstarter is heavily used by ‘artists’. Three of the four top campaign categories, by launch count, include theater, music, and film & video. The fourth top category is technology. Many of the remaining categories can also be considered art or art related (photography, publishing, journalism, food).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use Kickstarter if you are funding a play, especially if it will launch from Great Britain.</strong>
        <br>
        Plays, overall, are well supported by Kickstarter backers. As a sub-category of Theater, they make up nearly 26% of the total Kickstarter campaigns and over 65% succeed. This accounts for over 31% of all successful Kickstarters. Interestingly,  international theater campaigns have higher success rate than the US. While the US launches 90% more theater offers than the rest of the world, only 58% of non-live campaigns have reached a goal of 100% or more. International Theater offers have a success rate of nearly 67%. Of these International launches, 79% are from Great Britain. Plays account for 52% of all Kickstarters launched there. Of the concluded British campaigns for plays, 77% have been successes. Campaigns that asked for $5000 or less made up 73% of the successful British play offerings.
